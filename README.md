These are proof-of-concepts of JBoss AS 7, based on work done earlier
by Thomas Diesler and submitted to
[github](https://github.com/tdiesler/jbosgi/tree/d7caf3126fb35b823d083b238e7d974b06865396/testsuite/jbossas).

However, as it no longer contains the examples, and as they were in few
respects out-dated, this is my attempt of replicating some of that.

These are examples using Blueprint.

Build with mvn clean package, deploy with mvn jboss-as:deploy.
